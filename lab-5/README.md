# Lab 5: Working Around API Rate Limits

In this lab, you'll learn how to handle API rate limits effectively. APIs implement rate limiting to manage traffic, reduce costs, and protect against abuse such as DDoS attacks. Understanding how to work within these constraints is crucial for building robust applications.

## Why This Matters

API rate limits are essential for:

- **Cost Management:** Prevents excessive usage that could lead to high operational costs for API providers.
- **Security:** Protects APIs from being overwhelmed by traffic, which can be a result of malicious attacks like DDoS.
- **Fair Usage:** Ensures equitable access to the API for all users by preventing any single user from monopolizing resources.
