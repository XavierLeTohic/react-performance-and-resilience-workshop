# Overview

### Throughout the previous labs, we focused on:

	1.	Handling Unpredictable APIs: Improving the resilience of the application to gracefully handle intermittent API failures.
	2.	Request Optimization - Part One: Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce the load on third-party APIs and improve data retrieval efficiency.
	3.	Network Optimization - Reducing Payload Size and LocalStorage Usage: Reducing payload sizes and optimizing local storage to improve load times and overall application performance.
